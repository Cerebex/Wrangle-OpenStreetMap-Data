# Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
* This is a Udacity Project I complete to audit, clean and extract OpenStreetMaps data from an .osm file into SQLite 
	using python. 
* Please review [Sam_Millerâ€™s_OpenStreetMap_Case_Study.pdf]() to understand how I complete this project and the conclusions
	I drew from the data I reviewed. 
* I also pushed my code for [auditing]() as well as [cleaning and extracting]() my [OpenStreetMap database]().
