# Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
* This is a Udacity Project I complete to audit, clean and extract OpenStreetMaps data from an .osm file into SQLite 
	using python. 
* Please review [Sam_Miller’s_OpenStreetMap_Case_Study.pdf](Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data/Sam_Miller’s_OpenStreetMap_Case_Study.pdf) to understand how I complete this project and the conclusions
	I drew from the data I reviewed. 
* I also pushed my code for [auditing](Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data/data_audit.py) as well as [cleaning and extracting](Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data/data_cleaning_extraction.py) my smaller sample [OpenStreetMap database](Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data/sample.osm).
